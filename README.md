# Open source biomedical signal processing software
Codes and ideas developed during my studies, or simply for hobbies.

I intend to import the codes after cleaning them and gradually over time. All codes are free to use for educational purposes and the majority are free to use for medical signal diagnosis and processing, especially for low-resource communities.

Feel free to contact for potential collaborations or to discuss at sina \u< dot mohammadtaheri AT concordia dot ca >\u.

It is unethical to use them for training (code) generative AI's and language models.
